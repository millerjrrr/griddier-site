    FAQ: [
      {
        q: "Why did we create Griddier?",
        a: "Having a rough idea of preflop ranges is ok for low level play but I realized that the most efficient way to improve my technical game was to memorize my preflop ranges. Griddier makes perfect range memorization an achievable goal.",
      },
      {
        q: "Where do the ranges come from?",
        a: "Griddier comes pre-loaded with my personal ranges, carefully constructd for 100-1000NL rake structure. Frequencies are always rounded to the nearest 25% to make memorization achievable. Ranges can be edited (coming soon) and students can create their own ranges",
      },
      {
        q: "How does structured spaced repetition work?",
        a: "Structured spaced repetition is a learning method that schedules reviews of information at gradually increasing intervals. The idea is simple: every time you successfully recall something, the system waits a bit longer before showing it again, which strengthens long-term memory while cutting out wasted repetitions.\n\nA big drawback of traditional SSR is that you need to organize all those intervals yourself. Tracking what is due today, what was missed, and what needs to be reviewed next quickly becomes messy.\n\nGriddier removes that friction completely. It automates the repetition schedule behind the scenes so you can focus on studying, not managing a calendar of reviews.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much will Griddier cost after the launch phase?",
        a: "Griddier should be as affordable as it is powerful! We plan to launch at $20 a year!",
