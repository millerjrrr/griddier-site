# Unlocking Fluency: A Vocabulary-First Language Learning App

If you’re an advanced language learner, you know the struggle. The basics are behind you, but true fluency feels further away than ever. If you study one hour a day, you are spending twenty-three hours forgetting. Without a good system, it’s hard to make that one hour count.

That’s where **Link-King** comes in.

Designed specifically for mid-level to advanced learners, this language learning app helps you remember what you learn — efficiently and consistently.

## The Unique Challenges of Advanced Language Learners

As an advanced learner, you’re not starting from zero. You already know the basics and can hold simple conversations, but now you need to level up. Maybe you’re struggling to find the right resources, or you’re bored of repetitive beginner content.

Sound familiar? You’re not alone.

Many learners hit this same plateau — and Link-King is built to break through it.

What makes this language learning app so special?  
It focuses on what matters most at the advanced stage: **vocabulary expansion**.

To truly master a language, you need to understand it in all its forms. That means reading, listening, and immersing yourself — but that’s nearly impossible with a limited vocabulary.

## How This Language Learning App Helps You Improve Vocabulary

Expanding vocabulary can feel like climbing a never-ending mountain.  
Link-King turns this climb into an enjoyable, structured journey.

The app uses smart technology to introduce words tailored to your level and then drills them using efficient learning methods, ensuring you learn and remember them.

## Contextual Learning from Real Media

Link-King is designed to work alongside immersion.

We recommend:

- **10–20 minutes of drilling with Link-King**
- paired with
- **20–40 minutes (or more) of reading, listening to native music, or actively watching native media**

That’s right — most of your study time should be spent _outside_ the app.  
Link-King’s power is in accelerating your vocabulary growth so immersion becomes easier, more enjoyable, and more productive.

There’s no escaping immersion — but Link-King makes it far more effective.

## Spaced Repetition for Long-Term Retention

The app’s spaced repetition system shows you words **just before you forget them**, maximizing memory retention.

No more cramming. No more forgetting everything after a week.

Link-King uses **conditional, structured spaced repetition** — an optimized system that goes beyond the basic methods most apps use.

## Personalized Word Lists and Custom Learning

Link-King uses an **Elo rating system** to estimate your vocabulary ability and match you with the most useful words you haven't learned yet.

You’ll learn:

- highly frequent words
- words the algorithm detects you struggle with
- new words you manually add from books, songs, or conversations

Our dictionary is large, and when it isn’t enough, you can add **fully custom words** yourself.

## Why Link-King Stands Out as a Language Learning App

The answer is simple: **Link-King is simple.**

You drill words.  
That’s it.

It’s not flashy. It’s not gimmicky. It’s not pretending to be magical.

You want to learn a language — you need to learn words.  
There’s no way around it.

What _is_ clever is how Link-King drills those words: intuitive on the surface, highly optimized beneath it.

## AI Stories

Once you’ve collected your first **100 words**, you unlock **AI Stories**.

You can generate short stories built from your own vocabulary — stories you can comfortably read and understand.

This boosts:

- confidence
- contextual recognition
- natural reading ability

It’s fun, motivating, and incredibly effective.

## Audio Immersion

As you drill, Link-King uses your device’s text-to-speech to read words aloud.  
This means:

- the voice is customizable
- you get continuous exposure to natural pronunciation
- you can hide text to practice pure listening
