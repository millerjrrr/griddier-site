# How Long Does It Take to Learn a Language?

To answer this question, we need to clarify two things:

-1. What do we mean by **“learn a language”?**
-2. What do we mean by **“how long”**?

Let’s break it down.

## Defining “Learning a Language”

Learning a language isn’t a binary switch from _“I don’t speak it”_ to _“I speak it perfectly.”_  
It is a gradual process with multiple milestones.

To simplify things, here are **five levels of proficiency**:

### **MASTER**

You’ve achieved absolute mastery. You understand and use the language better than most native speakers. Virtually nobody reaches this level.

### **ELITE**

You surpass the majority of native speakers. You can handle nuanced, complex conversations effortlessly.

### **NATIVE (C1/C2)**

You are effectively indistinguishable from natives in daily conversation. You read native literature comfortably and enjoy native media with ease.

### **FLUENT (B1/B2)**

You speak smoothly and naturally in most daily settings, but you still miss key vocabulary. Advanced conversations, books, and native media are still challenging.

### **BEGINNER (A1/A2)**

You’ve completed some basic language courses or apps. You can handle simple interactions but struggle with complex ideas or fast speech.

Most native speakers don’t truly “master” their own language.  
For example:

- The Oxford English Dictionary includes **over 600,000 words**.
- Research suggests average native English speakers know **around 42,000 lemmas**.

That’s why, when people ask how many languages I speak, I like to joke:

> “Almost one.”

It’s fun, and it sparks interesting conversations about what “speaking a language” really means.

It also highlights how ridiculous it is when people boast about “speaking five or six languages” when they know only a handful of phrases.

I also find it funny when people compliment my Portuguese. When someone says:

> “Your Portuguese is really good,”

what they’re really saying is:

> “I can tell you’re not native, but you speak well enough.”

In contrast, my friend Maciej — who learned English as his second language, completed high school and university in English, and speaks better than most natives — rarely ever receives this compliment.

People simply assume he’s a native speaker.

That’s when you know you’ve made it.

## So Really, How Long Does It Take?

Now let’s address the second part: **“How long?”**

Saying “one year” means nothing unless we know:

- how many hours per day
- how much immersion
- how consistent the schedule is

Someone studying **8 hours a day** for a year will be miles ahead of someone studying **20 minutes a day** for a year.

This is why it is better to think in terms of **total hours**, not calendar time.

Consistency and intensity matter enormously.  
1,000 hours in one intense year is far more effective than 1,000 hours spread slowly over a decade.

When asked how long I’ve been learning Portuguese, my estimate is:

- **600 to 1,200 hours** of active learning  
  (including reading books, watching series, talking with locals, and using apps)

This is what matters—not the number of months passed.

## How Long Does It Take? It Depends on the Language.

According to the **U.S. Foreign Service Institute (FSI)**, languages fall into difficulty groups:

### **Easy Languages**

Spanish, French, Portuguese  
➡️ **600–750 hours** to conversational fluency

### **Moderate Difficulty**

German, Indonesian  
➡️ **≈ 900 hours**

### **Difficult**

Hindi, Russian, Greek, Thai  
➡️ **≈ 1,100 hours**

### **Very Difficult**

Arabic, Korean, Japanese, Chinese  
➡️ **2,200+ hours** for conversational fluency

These numbers offer realistic expectations:

- Reaching **B2 fluency** usually requires **600–1,100 hours**
- Reaching **C1/C2** takes significantly more

Once you hit advanced levels, progress becomes subtle and slow.  
This is why **vocabulary expansion** becomes crucial — and this is where **Link-King** shines.

## The Final Stretch: Why Link-King Matters

Link-King is specifically designed to help learners expand vocabulary efficiently.
