# What is an Elo Rating?

The **Elo rating system** ranks individuals based on how they perform against each other, adjusting dynamically after every result. It’s a flexible, evolving scorecard that reveals your true skill level over time.

Intrigued?  
Let’s explore how it works — and why it’s so popular.

## The Origin of the Elo Rating

The system was created by **Arpad Elo**, a Hungarian-American physicist and passionate chess player. Although best known in chess, Elo’s method is so effective that it has expanded into:

- video games
- competitive sports
- online matchmaking
- and now… **language learning apps like Link-King**

Elo’s idea was simple but brilliant:

> Your rating shouldn’t be based on participation.  
> It should reflect **who you beat** and **who beats you**.

Win against someone strong? Your rating climbs.  
Lose to someone much weaker? It takes a hit.

This dynamic adjustment makes Elo incredibly accurate.

## How Does the Elo Rating Work?

When two players (or systems) share the same Elo rating, the system predicts a **50/50** outcome.

If someone outperforms expectations:

- an **underdog wins** → rating jumps
- a **favorite loses** → rating drops

This constant balancing ensures Elo stays reflective of real skill.

If you enjoy the maths behind it, you can explore how it’s calculated (link).

## Why Use Elo for Language Learning?

Elo ratings provide three major benefits inside Link-King:

### **1. Competition**

Compete with friends and see who’s the best translator.  
Over time, higher Elo = more accurate translator.

It’s friendly, motivating, and surprisingly fun.

### **2. Personalized Content**

Elo helps determine which words you should learn next.

The system naturally introduces:

- useful vocabulary
- relevant difficulty
- personalized learning paths

Perfect for intermediate and advanced learners who need targeted growth.

### **3. Motivation**

Watching your rating rise is incredibly satisfying.  
Beyond stats or streaks, Elo gives you a **quantifiable measure** of progress.

## Elo Ratings and Progress Tracking

Elo is dynamic — it grows and shrinks with your performance.  
This makes it perfect for tracking real progress over time.

In Link-King, Elo works on **two levels**:

### **Your personal Elo rating**

Reflects how well you’re learning and translating vocabulary.

### **Word Elo ratings**

Each word has a difficulty rating based on **global user performance**.  
Harder words have higher ratings because fewer people get them right.

This dual system ensures you’re always:

- learning words appropriate to your level
- challenged just enough
- avoiding the trap of easy, repetitive vocabulary

Best of all, you can compare your rating with friends for a little friendly rivalry.  
Who’s the best translator in your group?  
With Elo, you’ll know.

## Conclusion: Climb Your Own Ladder

The Elo rating system isn’t just a ranking method — it’s a dynamic, motivating way to learn smarter.
