# Spaced Repetition: Link-King Won’t Let You Forget

Have you ever learned a word and thought, “This one’s sticking for sure!” only to forget it a week later?  
Don’t worry — we’ve all been there.

Language learning can feel like juggling words in the air… until one slips and vanishes.  
Enter **Link-King**, your language-learning app powered by a clever system called **structured spaced repetition**.

This isn’t just flashcards.  
This is forgetting prevention.

## How Link-King Works

Every time you get a word right in Link-King, the interval until you see it again grows. That interval determines the word’s _level_.

Example:  
If you correctly review a **level 3** word today, it becomes **level 4**, and you won’t see it again for seven days. As levels increase, the intervals get much longer. A **level 10** word might not appear again for several **years**.

If you forget a word, it returns to **level 1** to make sure it gets the attention it needs.

This system is known as **conditional spaced repetition** — a highly efficient way to keep your vocabulary fresh and focused.

As you practice consistently, your vocabulary graph begins to fill with higher-level words, giving you a crystal-clear picture of your long-term progress.

Just complete your daily goal — 15 minutes, 200 steps, or whatever it is — and **Link-King takes care of the rest**.

## The Science Behind Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is built on decades of cognitive science, dating back to the work of **Hermann Ebbinghaus** in the late 1800s. His research revealed the now-famous _forgetting curve_ — our tendency to forget information unless we review it at strategic intervals.

By reviewing material _just before_ we forget it, we strengthen neural pathways and dramatically improve retention.

The idea exploded in popularity with tools like **SuperMemo** in the 1980s, and today, apps like Link-King push these ideas further with adaptive algorithms that learn from your behavior.

For a deeper dive into the science, check out this excellent research overview on memory and learning. It’s fascinating to see how such a simple idea reshaped modern education.

## Structured Spaced Repetition vs Cramming

Cramming might feel productive, but it’s like pouring water into a sieve — it doesn’t last.

Structured spaced repetition is basically **cramming done right**:

- optimal
- efficient
- consistent

With Link-King, you review words at the perfect time, giving your brain the best chance to store them long-term.

This isn’t just about remembering a word.  
It’s about truly _owning_ it.

Imagine reading a book or watching a movie and suddenly recognizing a word you used to struggle with — that’s the power of structured spaced repetition in action.

## Why Link-King’s Spaced Repetition Stands Out

Many apps use spaced repetition.  
But Link-King goes further with **conditional** spaced repetition.

If you forget a word?  
Back to **level 1** for extra focus.

We also use an **Elo rating system** to introduce new words that fit your current ability level — but that’s a topic for another day.

What makes Link-King special is how seamlessly spaced repetition integrates into your daily routine. You’re not studying for an exam.  
You’re building a **lasting relationship** with the language.

By the time you’ve mastered a word, it feels like second nature.
