# The Story of Link-King

Link-King was born from frustration, perseverance, and a personal mission to bridge a gap no other language learning tool could fill.

After finishing the course on Duolingo, I felt great, but not for long. Knowing some of the advanced conjugations felt impractical when I lacked the vocabulary of even a young child. While I had learned the basics of Portuguese, I was far from fluent. I couldn’t enjoy Portuguese media or follow complex conversations. It was frustrating. Many of the “best language apps for advanced learners” promise fluency but none of them deliver.

Determined to bridge the gap, I searched for something—anything—that could take my Portuguese to the next level. But I came up empty-handed. So, I decided to create the solution myself. That’s how **Link-King** was born.

## From Google Sheets to a Full-Blown App

In the beginning, I started reading in Portuguese. It was tough. Unknown words piled up faster than I could handle, and I quickly realized I needed a system to manage them. I began logging every new word into Google Sheets, creating a study tool for myself. Over time, I refined the system, making it more efficient and effective.

It worked so well that I thought, _Why not share this idea with the world?_ That’s when the idea of Link-King started to take shape. The goal was simple: help people expand their vocabulary quickly and efficiently, giving them the tools they need to immerse themselves in real-world media.

By October 2023, I was ready to take the leap and commit full-time to developing Link-King into a functional app. I had some coding experience and a natural knack for it, but I was far from an expert. When I started, I didn’t even know that JavaScript and HTML were the basics of web development. I threw myself into learning, devouring Udemy courses—an excellent platform offering affordable courses on everything from web development to design—and working tirelessly.

By January, I had built a functional web app.

## Creating a Tool for Advanced Learners

Link-King focuses on what I believe is the most important aspect of language learning: **vocabulary acquisition**.

Think about it. Even if you know every grammar rule, you’ll be lost without a broad vocabulary. You might have a perfect accent, but if you can’t understand half the words in a conversation, people will just think you’re clueless.

Now, imagine the reverse. Let’s say you don’t know much grammar, but you’ve been working with Link-King and you have a huge vocabulary. Now you can follow high-level conversations and enjoy books and movies. From there, grammar comes naturally through meaningful exposure.

That’s the idea behind Link-King: a simple yet powerful tool to help you build a strong foundation of vocabulary so you can learn the rest through immersion.

## From Web to Mobile: Overcoming Challenges

While the web app was a great start, I wanted more. I wanted Link-King to be truly outstanding. So, I decided to build a mobile app—despite having zero experience in mobile development.

Did you know that over **84 percent** of the global population has access to a mobile phone, **68 percent** owns a smartphone, and approximately **59 percent** have access to a computer?

It was a steep learning curve, but I was determined. I’ve always been fascinated by software development, and this project gave me the perfect excuse to dive deeper.

The journey wasn’t easy. I worked tirelessly, learning everything I could about mobile development and figuring out how to turn my vision into reality. The result? A fast, effective, and user-friendly app that I’m incredibly proud of. Of course, the work never stops. There’s always room for improvement, and I’m constantly refining the app to make it even better.

## The Real Challenge: Sharing Link-King with the World

Developing Link-King was tough, but marketing it has been an even bigger challenge. I’ve poured my heart and soul into this app, creating one of the best language apps for advanced learners. Now, I need to get it into the hands of people who need it most.

Link-King isn’t just another language app. It’s a tool born from frustration, determination, and a passion for creating something transformative. It’s for those who have mastered the basics and are ready to take their skills to the next level.

Whether you’re trying to bridge the gap between beginner and fluent or searching for a better way to learn, Link-King is here to help.
