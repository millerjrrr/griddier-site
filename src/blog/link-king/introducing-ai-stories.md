# Introducing AI Stories

## Discover the Magic of AI Stories in Link-King

If you’ve ever wanted **undeniable proof** that you’re making progress in your language-learning journey, AI Stories is here to blow you away.

This powerful new feature in Link-King takes the vocabulary you’ve learned and turns it into **custom stories**, making your progress not just measurable — but _magical_.

AI Stories isn’t just about learning words.  
It’s about bringing them to life.

## How AI Stories Work: Turning Vocabulary Into Confidence

AI Stories selects a subset of the lemmas you’ve recently learned (what’s a lemma? Check the FAQ!) and uses them to **generate a story tailored specifically for you**.

These stories:

- reinforce the vocabulary you already know
- build confidence through readable content
- help you _feel_ your progress instantly
- engage you emotionally while you learn

And yes — you can customize the style.  
Want a dramatic adventure? A cozy slice-of-life? A fantasy tale?  
AI Stories adapts to you.

Best of all:  
Stories include only vocabulary you already know, so you’re never overwhelmed.

## Who Can Access This Feature?

AI Stories unlocks automatically when you reach **level 3 in at least 100 lemmas**.

Why the threshold?

Because compelling stories need enough vocabulary to:

- form sentences
- convey emotion
- create meaningful context

This milestone ensures your stories are rich, engaging, and confidence-boosting — a reward for your dedication.

Once unlocked, you’ll never look at your vocabulary list the same way again.

## Why You’ll Love AI Stories

Picture this:

You finish your daily Link-King drills.  
You generate an AI Story.  
You sit back and read — smoothly.

And it hits you:  
**You’re comfortably reading in another language.**

For many learners, this is the first time they _feel_ fluent.

AI Stories also helps you practice recognizing lemmas in their **conjugated or inflected** forms. For example, if you’ve learned _dizer_ in Portuguese, you might see:

- “ele diz”
- “eles dizem”
- “dizendo”

The context makes these discoveries effortless and fun.

## Personalized and Customizable

Every AI Story is generated using only the vocabulary you’ve learned.  
That means:

- no confusion
- no stopping to translate
- no overwhelm
- pure flow

You can personalize:

- themes
- settings
- tones
- genres

And the system currently supports **all six target languages** available in Link-King — with more on the way.

## Users Are Loving It

Early feedback has been incredible.

Many learners say that reading their first AI Story gave them their **biggest confidence boost yet**.

Why?

Because opening a real book in your target language is intimidating when you don’t know half the words.  
AI Stories bridges that gap by generating stories that are:

- familiar
- readable
- achievable
- fully within your vocabulary

It’s a safe stepping stone to reading real native content.

You’re not just learning lemmas —  
you’re learning how they behave in actual sentences.

## Getting Started With AI Stories

Once you reach the 100-lemma milestone:

-1. Go to the **Statistics** page in Link-King
-2. Click on **AI Stories**
-3. Generate your first story
-4. Sit back, read, enjoy, and _feel your progress_

Use it as a treat after training, a warm-up before immersion, or a way to wind down before bed.

## Conclusion: AI Stories Bring Language Learning to Life

With AI Stories, Link-King is redefining what’s possible in language learning.

It’s not about memorizing lists or passing tests — it’s about:

- building confidence
- celebrating progress
- growing your vocabulary
- enjoying the journey

Whether you’re just beginning or already advanced, AI Stories gives you a powerful tool to make your learning _come alive_.
