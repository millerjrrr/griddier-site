# My Language Learning Story

My language learning story began in September 2020 at the age of 27. At the time, I wasn’t exactly a language prodigy. Sure, I had studied French and Irish in high school, but I wouldn’t describe myself as particularly gifted in language learning. What I did have, however, was plenty of motivation.

I had fallen in love with a Brazilian woman, now my wife, and was planning to spend a significant amount of time in Brazil. To truly enjoy that time, I needed to speak the language. And to really thrive there, I wanted to speak it well.

## The Early Days: Duolingo and Basic Conversations

When I began the Portuguese course on Duolingo, I was excited. I believed that if I worked hard enough to complete the course, I’d be fluent by the end. I committed to studying at least 30 minutes a day, often an hour. I completed the course quickly, but to my disappointment, I was far from fluent.

I could barely hold a one-on-one conversation and constantly needed explanations for words, limited by my small vocabulary. As of September 2023, <a href="https://ardslot.com/duolingocrowns.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duolingo’s Portuguese course includes only about **2,855 words**</a> — not nearly enough for fluency! Worse, many of those words were given minimal focus and inefficient repetition.

When I first arrived in Brazil, I quickly realized that while Duolingo had helped, it wasn’t the magic solution I’d hoped for. I could hold basic conversations if the person was patient enough, but gestures and guessing were still doing most of the heavy lifting.

Group conversations? Completely overwhelming. Missing even one key word meant I was lost.

## A New Chapter: Discovering the Power of Reading

When apps weren’t enough, the next step for me was reading.

I wanted something more advanced and immersive, but I couldn’t find any tools that clicked. So I decided to challenge myself.

Even though I love reading in English, reading in a second language is a different world. But I picked a book that meant something to me:  
**The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm**, by Christopher Paolini.

At first, I had to look up new words almost every sentence. It was painfully slow. But I knew that reading exposes you to vocabulary in context, and I believed that to speak Portuguese well, I needed to read — and read a lot.

Starting with a story I cared about made the process easier and more enjoyable.

## Struggles and Spreadsheets: My Secret to Retaining Words

Reading in Portuguese wasn’t smooth at first. I managed only seven pages a day, looking up constant new words.

To actually remember them, I started adding every unfamiliar word to a spreadsheet. Each day I spent:

- **15 minutes reviewing previous words**
- **45+ minutes reading forward**

It worked, but it became cumbersome fast.

So I began writing **macros** to automate everything: sorting words, tracking review dates, and implementing a structured spaced-repetition system.  
<a href="https://blog.wranx.com/the-science-behind-spaced-repetition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s an article explaining the science behind spaced repetition.</a>

It helped immensely.

## The Turning Point: Fluent Reading and Real Progress

By the time I reached my third book, everything started to click. My reading speed improved, I stopped needing translations, and I added over **2,000 lemmas** to my vocabulary.

By the end of **The Inheritance Cycle**, I was reading fluently for hours at a time.

Fast forward to today:

- **11 books completed in Portuguese**
- **1.5 million+ words read** on Kindle
- Can understand obscure vocabulary like _promontório_, _careta_, and _miúdos_

This was the breakthrough I’d been chasing.

## Building a Better System: The App That Changed Everything

Although my spreadsheet worked well, it wasn’t scalable.

Managing hundreds of words manually was overwhelming, so I built a **simple web app** to streamline everything. By my third book, the app had replaced my entire workflow.

Over the past year and a half, I’ve used the app to learn **4,000+ new lemmas**. It reinforced my vocabulary, sped up my progress, and made the entire process enjoyable.

Now, I can confidently:

- participate in multiway conversations
- handle doctor’s appointments in Portuguese
- understand everything being said around me

The app was a game changer.

## Lessons Learned: Tips for Your Own Language Learning Story

If you're starting your own journey, here’s what I’d recommend:

- **Focus on vocabulary first**
- Learn words **in context**, not in isolation
- Read early and read often
- Use structured spaced repetition
- Use apps like Duolingo for the basics, but don’t stop there

My app is built around these principles. It helps you retain vocabulary efficiently through scientifically structured spaced repetition. The best part: **it's free** and better than ever.

## Conclusion: Try the App for Yourself

My language learning story is far from over, but I’ve come a long way — and my app played a massive role in that progress.

Today, I read fluently, engage in conversations easily, and navigate life in Brazil with confidence.

If you want to take your language learning to the next level, give the app a try.
